# Slime Survival 2.0
Heavily work in progress rework of the entirety of Slime Survival.
Expect a *playable* test server around early to mid December.

## Planned Reworks
* Replacement of old races with some going out and being replaced with new ones.
	* Human
		* All players will initially start off as a human and have to become other races through certain rituals or events.
		* Human upgrades are unlocked as long as you do not change over to a different race.
	* Creeper
		* The old style but with a new focus on chemistry and brewing.
	* Slime
		* The old style but a bigger focus on cell genetics and mutations?
	* Druid
		* A rehash of Flora equipped to be a better balance between defense, support, and offense.
	* Arachnid
		* Stealth, debuffing, crits, and dodge.
	* Vampire
		* Immunity to various ailments as well as the ability to dish out large amounts of damage but has a weakness against fire, natural light, and holyness.
	* Demon
		* Able to perform satanic rituals and necromancy as well as fire-related attacks and defenses, but suffers greatly from holyness (more than vampires).
* Guns/weapons are going to be completely reworked in order to provide a more arcade-like feeling in the mid-late game while a grueling *hands-on* experience early-mid game.
	* Split into six categories
		* Primitive
			* Weapons are based off prior to the invention of gunpowder and are mostly arrow and melee based.
		* Medieval
			* Based off the Dark Ages and Colonial Age and feature weapons such as flintlocks and muskets
		* Wartorn
			* Based off the World Wars era of weaponry
		* Modern
			* Based off Cold War and Early 21st Century weaponry
		* Futuristic
			* Weapons that are Sci-Fi or relatively modernish
		* Mystical
			* Fantasy weapons that don't really have much of an explanation other than magic
